# My-Neighbors-Groceries
This is a project developed for the Code:Louisville January SD1 course (Tuesdays)

I wanted to creatively display an image within the console while telling a mildly funny story. It presents the user with a title screen and waits for key input to proceed or exit. Then it asked the user what the programs neighbor might be buying from the grocery because they have never seen them bring any in. It takes the user's response, processes it and compares it to a dictionary of keys with corresponding id strings. It matches the id string to a product class and then pulls the information within that class for display in the console.

Project Features:

1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
2. Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
3. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
4. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
5. Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
6.& Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data

& Not sure if this applies for how I visualized a PNG file

Notes on running this program:
It targets Windows so Windows 10 and below should run flawlessly, however on Windows 11 due to a change in how the console works you must do the following:
1. Change your terminal font to Consolas:

2. Change the terminal output to Windows Console Host. This can be done in Settings > Privacy > For Developers > Terminal.
