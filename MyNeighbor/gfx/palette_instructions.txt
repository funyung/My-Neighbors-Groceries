The main thing is making an image that is a 64x44 PNG file with an indexed color palette (palette.act)

My process, done with Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Should be similar in newer versions)
-----------------------------------
Adjust Brightness to roughly -32
Adjust Contrast to roughly +64
Biliniar Image Scale to 64 width or 44 height, depending on the picture.
Adjust Canvas Size to to fill out 64 width or 44 height, based on your scaling.
Convert to Indexed Color with 6 colors using pallette.act 
Adjust diffusion for image clarity
Save as .png with no Compression and no Interlacing
